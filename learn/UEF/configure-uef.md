# Configuring an Ultra Extension Framework Integration in Learn

The Ultra Extension Framework (UEF) encompasses a broad array of features and functionality, and as such, each UEF-enabled integration will have its own specific configuration settings. However, the setup process followed by a Blackboard Learn System Administrator leverages existing standard configuration workflows already in place. Generally speaking, adding a UEF-enabled integration to a Blackboard Learn environment requires a System Admin to make configuration changes to one or more of the following areas:

REST API Integrations: Most UEF-enabled integrations will need to be added as a REST API integration [Administrator Panel ⇨ REST API Integrations ⇨ Create Integration].

LTI Tool Providers: Most UEF-enabled integrations will need to be registered as an LTI Tool Provider [Administrator Panel ⇨ LTI Tool Providers ⇨ Register Provider Domain/Register LTI 1.3 Tool]. In addition to the existing "Course tool", "Course content tool", "System tool", and "Administrator Tool" type options, some UEF integrations may also utilize the new “Ultra extension” LTI Placement Type option.

New LTI Placement Type: "Ultra extension"
As part of the Ultra integration framework development, it's necessary to define a way for Learn admins to register an Ultra integration and how the registered integrations are going to be loaded inside Ultra:
•	We'll keep the current registration workflow for LTI 3rd party tools, but a new placement type will be added so that is possible to know when an LTI tool is expected to work as an Ultra UI integration.
•	The new LTI placement type will be known as "Ultra UI integration" and such type will only be visible for Learn Ultra instances.

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing: For UEF-enabled integrations that make direct calls to their Blackboard Learn instance's REST API will need be be configured via the Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) tool [Administrator Panel ⇨ Cross-Origin Resource Sharing ⇨ Create Configuration].
