In August 2016, our friends at [AllTheDucks](https://alltheducks.com) presented on their work integrating with the Blackboard Learn REST APIs using [Golang](https://golang.org). 

Following DevCon ANZ, the Ducks were kind enough to open source their project and write a blog to help developers learn the Golang REST Application they wrote.</p>

The blog can be found [here](https://blog.alltheducks.com/post/go-rest).
